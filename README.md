Breakout type game in JS
----------------------------------------

There are a few bugs regarding random spawn of not activated blocks

A few upgrades could be made in areas of lives, pointer to a cursor for better aim, different types of blocks (triangle etc.)

Comment:

First game ever, especially in JS and HTML canvas
